Why do you need this application
The increasing exposure of prepubescent children aged 12-14 to pornographic media enables them to engage in normal 
sexual activity at a younger age. However, information about sex is not readily available to preadolescent children. 
Only 65% of schools offer sex education, let alone explain condom use. Conversations at home are often awkward. 
Preadolescent girls need better choices in reproductive health and self-esteem education. 
They are at risk for pregnancy and sexually transmitted infections (STI), 
but little information about the risks and responsibilities associated with sex reaches pre-puberty. In addition, 
preteens struggle with self-esteem, leaving them vulnerable to peer influence and the media. 
Current trends in preadolescent sexual behavior affect the economy, undermine family cohesion, 
affect women's education, and burden the health care system.
